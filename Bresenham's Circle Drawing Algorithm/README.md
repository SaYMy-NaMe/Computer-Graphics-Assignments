# Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm Implementation in Python

### also known as: Iterative Circle Drawing Algorithm

**Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm** is a circle drawing algorithm that selects the nearest pixel position to complete the arc. The unique part of this algorithm is that is uses only integer arithmetic which makes it, significantly, faster than other algorithms using floating point arithmetic in classical processors.
